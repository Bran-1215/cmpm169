				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment generates a random sentence with an emotion and action using Tracery. The slider on the bottom controls the intensity of the sentence.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This code generates a randomly structured sentence using a Tracery grammar object. The sentences created are based on the current state, where State 1 limits emotions and actions to "happy," "sad," and "angry," while State 2 and 3 allow 3 more extended emotions. State 3 uniquely selects an action from any category, regardless of the chosen emotion. The text is also dynamically color-coded based on its emotional category, and it prevents duplicate sentences.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Brian Delinela - I like what I've made here. It took a while to get going because I was just experiencing a block, but I was inspired by working with my group on our final project. It's also related to emotions so I wanted to deal with them in this experiment. I thought parsing through the Tracery grammar object was the most difficult part of this experiment. Since I particularly had some complex rules with this experiment, I felt I stretched the way I utilized the object, restricting the randomness of it.</p>
