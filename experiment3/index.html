				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, I wanted to simulate the growth of slime mold using cellular automata, but I ended up with something more akin to gray goo.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This experiment simulates slime mold behavior using a grid-based cellular automata system. The canvas is divided into cells, each representing slime density, chemical signals, or food, with growth and decay driven by rules influenced by chemical gradients and randomness. Slime molds grow toward food sources, decay when overcrowded, and respawn in a central region if no slime remains. Interactive features include a 2x2 erase tool triggered by mouse input. </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Brian Delinela - I felt I struggled a bit more on this experiment than the previous one, but at the same time I felt a lot more satisfied with the end product. Maybe I went too overboard with the complexity of simulating the slime mold and could have gone simpler. Though, I am pleased I was able to take a long-running problem I had with the slimeâ€™s decay and use an alternative approach to incorporate it into my experiment. </p>
