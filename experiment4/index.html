				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Drag images into the canvas to watch them bounce around and give you a headache. Click on them to remove them.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Images are drawn onto the canvas as balls that move and collide with each other. Each collision increases the volume of a continuous tone, which in turn increases a blur effect and the change in background. Additionally, the more balls there are, the higher the frequency of the tone. Each collision decreases the size of the balls until they reach a minimum size, at this point they are removed from the canvas.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Brian Delinela - I found this experiment to be much more challenging than the previous ones. At first I had trouble integrating sound together with visuals/images, and made some discordant implementations in the beginning. Though my final iteration was still pretty weird, I liked it because it gave me the impression of a more violent form of brain fog. Figuring out that the browser itself was blocking audio from playing was a headache in itself.</p>
