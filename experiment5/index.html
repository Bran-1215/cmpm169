				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a recreation of the mountain landscapes found in the music video for Porter Robinson's Sad Machine. The hand featured in that music video also follows the mouse, and the canvas can be interacted with by holding the mouse button and dragging up and down.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The experiment uses Perlin noise to generate a mountain landscape, with an offset in the middle to create the valley. A 2d image of a robotic hand is imposed on the 3d space and is translated according to mouse position. The mouse position is also mapped to the height and color of the canvas, so they can be influenced when holding mouse click.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Brian Delinela - When I saw that this experiment dealt with 3D graphics, I instantly wanted to pay homage to Porter Robinson and Worlds (the album). I am happy with what I came up with, but I really wanted to do more. There were two more landscapes in that music video that could have fit the generative design of this experiment so much and I planned to add transitions into them, but I already spent a lot of time tweaking and making the mountain landscape work. </p>
