          <p>In this experiment, I wanted to added mouse interactivity to an existing project of nodes. The nodes are repelled by the mouse, but are attracted when left clicking.</p>

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>The main features, mouse repelling and attracting, works by computing a force vector and adding it to the node's velocity. This force vector is determined using the distance between the mouse and node and whether the mouse is pressed or not. All this functionality is put within a function in Node.js, which is called in sketch.js.</p>
        </div>

            Brian Delinela - Starting from a pre-existing project, I contributed in writing code (and modifying code from ChatGPT). I'm satisfied with the end product of this experiment, but there's an itch deep down wanting to do more. I guess part of the creative process is knowing when to stop on an existing project to make room for more. It was a hassle trying to get the code from Generative Design to work well with the framework we have with our static webpage. It took a while to figure out how to remove a duplicate sketch from the canvas, and I think just emptying my cache fixed it.
